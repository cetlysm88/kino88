00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:41.833

Read, Rector!

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:54.466
Rector!

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:13.276
Now that you're going home, try to stay out of mischief!

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.779
On the last vacation, two seminarians,

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:20.492
disguised as devils, were caught stealing chickens.

00:03:21.076 --> 00:03:24.287
Zozulia and Lemesh, I mean you!

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:29.292
The other three had gotten a deacon drunk,

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:33.171
and then goaded him into singing bawdy, indecent songs!

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.173
For shame!

00:03:35.507 --> 00:03:37.884
And now, let us pray together.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.765
Lord, let the Light of Thy wisdom shine down upon us.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:52.149
And bestow on our hearts Thy tender mercy.

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:04.369
Preserve us from all evil.

00:04:06.121 --> 00:04:08.999
And Heaven and Earth will resound with glorious

00:04:09.291 --> 00:04:11.001
songs of praise.

00:04:16.173 --> 00:04:17.549
Amen.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.220
Be sure you return in time for the

00:04:22.512 --> 00:04:25.182
Feast of the Immaculate Conception!

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:16.668
We should've spotted a farm long ago.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.880
The devil would lose his way in this darkness, too.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.256
Where did the road go?

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:26.386
There is no road.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:30.223
Look, Khaliava, you go that way. I'm going over this way.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:32.934
And Gorobetz...

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:35.811
Gorobetz...

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:40.774
Hey, Gorobetz!

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.490
Damn it. I mistook a rotten stump for your head.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:49.992
What did you find?

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:52.495
Just fox holes.

00:07:04.382 --> 00:07:05.800
Well, what should we do?

00:07:06.593 --> 00:07:08.803
Let's sing at the top of our lungs.

00:07:09.095 --> 00:07:10.095
Quiet!

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:14.851
I know, let's sleep under the stars.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.147
No, Khaliava, that won't do.

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:25.153
We have to keep looking. Someone might give us a glass of vodka.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.953
Sure... It's better than sleeping under the stars.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:42.545
There's a farm house ahead.

00:07:51.262 --> 00:07:52.263
Come on!

00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:05.443
Brothers, it's our last chance to find a place to stay.

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.238
- Open up! - Hello?

00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:10.407
Who is it?

00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:13.493
Khaliava, the theologian.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:16.079
- Brutus, the philosopher. - Gorobetz, the orator.

00:08:16.579 --> 00:08:21.710
No, the house is full of people. Where would I put you?

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.170
Have mercy on us, my good woman!

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.674
It's unforgivable to let Christian souls perish at night!

00:08:27.966 --> 00:08:29.592
Just give us somewhere to sleep!

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:33.430
And if we do something wrong...

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:39.769
All right, but each of you must sleep in separate places.

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:42.105
Whatever you wish!

00:08:58.913 --> 00:09:03.418
- Listen, good woman... - We're dying of hunger.

00:09:04.085 --> 00:09:06.046
It's been so long since we've eaten.

00:09:06.337 --> 00:09:12.093
There's nothing to eat. I haven't lit the stove all day.

00:09:12.385 --> 00:09:15.555
Tomorrow we'll see that you're rewarded handsomely.

00:09:18.892 --> 00:09:20.661
You couldn't get a crumb out of the old skinflint!

00:09:20.685 --> 00:09:21.728
The hell with her!

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:28.068
- Boy, I want you to come here. - Who? Me?

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.991
You can sleep in the house.

00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:51.716
And you, the tall one, up in the loft.

00:10:01.935 --> 00:10:04.813
- Well, where will I stay? - Come with me.

00:11:04.122 --> 00:11:06.082
What do you want, granny?

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.172
No, it's the time of lent.

00:11:12.547 --> 00:11:15.633
And not for all the gold in the world would I let you tempt me.

00:11:20.555 --> 00:11:22.432
You're not in the flower of youth, you know.

00:11:52.170 --> 00:11:54.714
What's wrong with you, granny? For the love of God!

00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.332
Good Lord, she's a witch.

00:13:17.046 --> 00:13:21.009
Shameless witch! Put me down! Let me be!

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:22.844
In the name of God,

00:13:23.177 --> 00:13:25.388
Jesus Christ, put me down! Let me be!

00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.812
If I'm not making you fly, it must be Christ

00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.689
and his apostle, Thomas!

00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:05.053
Oh, you're killing me!

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:04.463
Khoma.

00:16:10.970 --> 00:16:11.970
Scat!

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:23.524
- What we need is tar. - I know that.

00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.320
Hey, Khoma.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:30.155
What is it?

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:33.159
The Rector sent me to get you. Someone came for you.

00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:03.189
Ah, it's you, brother Khoma.

00:17:04.315 --> 00:17:06.400
The daughter of one of our richest Sotniks is dying.

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:09.570
The one who owns the estate just twenty miles outside Kiev.

00:17:10.154 --> 00:17:12.448
Yesterday, the girl returned home, beaten almost to death.

00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:17.286
She expressed a wish that in her final agony,

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:21.916
the last prayers for her salvation be said by you,

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.626
Khoma Brutus.

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.127
Why me?

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.523
I don't even know how to do that!

00:17:27.547 --> 00:17:30.174
Don't argue with me! You will leave immediately.

00:17:30.466 --> 00:17:34.011
The famous Sotnik was good enough to send his men

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:35.596
and a wagon.

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.410
You'll have to get someone else to go, because I'm not leaving!

00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:42.812
No one asked you if you wanted to go or not.

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:49.151
Thank your good master for his gift of the honey and eggs.

00:17:49.777 --> 00:17:54.574
And tell him I shall send the books when they're ready.

00:17:57.034 --> 00:18:03.082
And as for you, I suggest you learn to control your tongue.

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:07.253
Otherwise, I'll have you lashed before the whole school,

00:18:07.587 --> 00:18:09.714
so you won't be able to sit for a week.

00:18:10.172 --> 00:18:12.466
Now do as I say!

00:18:14.885 --> 00:18:18.264
The Lord be with you, and with your good master.

00:18:22.184 --> 00:18:25.771
Yavtukh, see that our friends have vodka before they leave.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.194
Well, don't just stand there. Be off with you!

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:37.074
And if you know what's good for you, you'll mend your ways!

00:18:39.702 --> 00:18:42.204
You'd better tie up the philosopher

00:18:42.496 --> 00:18:44.415
so he won't be tempted to run off!

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:51.213
- Good day, my brothers. - Good day, brother philosopher.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:55.718
I've been ordered to travel in your company.

00:18:59.138 --> 00:19:05.102
- A splendid carriage! - Yes, a spacious one!

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:08.522
We could hire some musicians and dance with all this room!

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:33.589
I wonder, if it were filled with a heavy load -

00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:38.344
say you loaded up the wagon with salt or metal poles -

00:19:38.886 --> 00:19:40.846
how many horses would it take?

00:19:44.558 --> 00:19:47.687
It would take a lot of horses if you had a lot of salt.

00:19:49.146 --> 00:19:52.358
Can you tell me what sort of illness the girl is cursed with,

00:19:52.650 --> 00:19:55.069
that such solemn prayers are required to deliver her soul?

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:03.637
Sit down, brother philosopher. We're not there yet.

00:21:30.372 --> 00:21:34.168
- Stop! - An inn! Stop!

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:42.927
Whoa, girl, whoa! We're there.

00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:51.936
Let's go in, brother philosopher.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.773
Spirid, don't forget to water the horses.

00:21:59.443 --> 00:22:01.695
Welcome, my friends. Please come inside.

00:22:01.987 --> 00:22:06.116
- Do you have vodka? - Yes, step inside.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.510
My friends, I propose a toast to the health of the Rector.

00:22:27.555 --> 00:22:31.559
Here's to the health of the Rector.

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:34.478
Drink, my good friends.

00:22:50.744 --> 00:22:58.744
Oh, the Cossack drinks on someone else's money...

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:06.927
Another round!

00:23:07.303 --> 00:23:15.303
Another round! Another round! Serve another round!

00:23:20.232 --> 00:23:25.070
I'd like to know one thing. Just what are you seminarians taught?

00:23:25.654 --> 00:23:31.535
What the deacon says when he's in church? Or other things?

00:23:37.833 --> 00:23:39.209
What a great scholar.

00:23:39.501 --> 00:23:43.297
I want to be a seminarian, too.

00:23:44.048 --> 00:23:48.844
Do you think I'm not clever enough? I can learn anything!

00:23:49.136 --> 00:23:51.513
Oh, good Lord! Have mercy on us!

00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:00.314
The Cossack drinks on someone else's...

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.450
- I just want to know one thing. - Leave me alone, pest!

00:24:13.327 --> 00:24:19.041
Don't ask him. Only God knows everything.

00:24:19.416 --> 00:24:24.421
I just want to know what's written in those books.

00:24:24.964 --> 00:24:26.715
There could be other things in them.

00:24:27.007 --> 00:24:30.094
How can you talk that way?

00:24:33.097 --> 00:24:37.768
- Let me go. - Why not let him go?

00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:41.105
Philosopher.

00:24:45.734 --> 00:24:50.197
Don't be afraid. Come here. The master will never know.

00:24:54.368 --> 00:24:58.288
- Don't just stand there. - Let me go home, my brothers!

00:24:59.039 --> 00:25:00.457
Let me go home!

00:25:38.328 --> 00:25:40.372
The young woman is dead.

00:25:42.082 --> 00:25:43.208
The girl is dead.

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.636
Be quiet! The young woman is dead!

00:25:55.387 --> 00:25:57.765
- The girl is dead? - Dead? Already?

00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:11.070
Quiet, Serko! The young woman is dead!

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:19.411
Why don't we let Khoma go now?

00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:29.046
- Of course we'll let him go. - He can do as he wants.

00:26:31.799 --> 00:26:33.509
Leave him alone.

00:26:43.393 --> 00:26:44.978
The young woman is dead.

00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:19.763
Come on, you silly pig!

00:27:48.458 --> 00:27:51.837
Brother philosopher, you're wrong to try to leave.

00:27:52.337 --> 00:27:55.716
It's not the sort of place you can escape from.

00:27:56.758 --> 00:28:00.888
You'd better go to the master. He's waiting for you.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.930
Why not?

00:28:04.683 --> 00:28:05.934
I'd love to meet him.

00:28:14.776 --> 00:28:17.779
It's not so much the pain of losing you, my dearest daughter,

00:28:18.071 --> 00:28:20.657
in the flower of your youth, that makes your loss more

00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:24.369
than a father can bear,

00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:27.539
as the torment I suffer,

00:28:28.165 --> 00:28:34.046
at not knowing what monster was the cause of your death.

00:28:45.307 --> 00:28:48.936
Who are you? What's your quality, and where are you from?

00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:52.522
From the seminary. My name is Khoma Brutus.

00:28:56.443 --> 00:28:57.611
And who was your father?

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:01.281
I don't know.

00:29:02.115 --> 00:29:03.200
Your mother, then?

00:29:04.618 --> 00:29:06.203
I never knew her, either.

00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:09.623
Of course, I must have had one, like anyone else,

00:29:10.207 --> 00:29:14.878
but who she was, or what she was like, I never knew.

00:29:16.213 --> 00:29:18.840
How did you make the acquaintance of my daughter?

00:29:29.518 --> 00:29:32.312
I never met your daughter, sir.

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:38.443
I know nothing of girls. I swear I've never known one.

00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:42.114
Why did she call for you by name then?

00:29:44.408 --> 00:29:46.660
Only God knows why.

00:29:48.370 --> 00:29:51.373
The rich people fancy things that don't make sense,

00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:53.417
even to a scholar.

00:29:53.792 --> 00:29:55.002
As the saying goes,

00:29:55.294 --> 00:29:57.214
"When masters fall out, their men get the clout."

00:29:57.337 --> 00:29:59.214
You're not lying, are you, philosopher?

00:29:59.923 --> 00:30:03.468
May God strike me dead if I'm lying.

00:30:16.231 --> 00:30:18.734
If she had lived a minute longer,

00:30:19.026 --> 00:30:20.777
I would have known everything.

00:30:24.489 --> 00:30:26.700
"Let no one say prayers for me, father,

00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:30.329
but send men at once to Kiev Seminary.

00:30:31.788 --> 00:30:34.374
Tell them to bring seminarian Khoma Brutus here.

00:30:35.292 --> 00:30:38.378
Let him pray for three nights for the salvation of my soul.

00:30:39.755 --> 00:30:41.089
He knows."

00:30:42.007 --> 00:30:49.056
And what does he know, that I hadn't time to hear?

00:30:54.936 --> 00:31:00.359
Have you been known for your chaste life?

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.570
Could she have heard about you from someone?

00:31:04.363 --> 00:31:05.363
Me?

00:31:06.698 --> 00:31:10.869
Chaste life? For heaven's sake, sir!

00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:17.084
I visited a baker's wife on Maundy Thursday.

00:31:23.090 --> 00:31:25.801
Nevertheless, she named you. That's all that counts.

00:31:27.177 --> 00:31:30.222
As of tonight, you will begin reciting prayers for her soul.

00:31:31.556 --> 00:31:34.059
Yes, but certainly you want to do the best thing...

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:40.107
Of course, anyone versed in the Scriptures could do it...

00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:46.696
But the best thing would be to have a deacon, or a sub-deacon.

00:31:47.948 --> 00:31:51.743
They're well trained and will do what's necessary.

00:31:52.452 --> 00:31:56.665
My voice isn't suitable and I don't have a good appearance.

00:31:56.957 --> 00:32:01.294
I'll do as my dear child wanted it done.

00:32:01.837 --> 00:32:03.713
I don't care what it may cost.

00:32:04.423 --> 00:32:06.341
You will start your vigil tonight,

00:32:06.633 --> 00:32:10.637
and recite the prayers for three nights.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.683
I shall reward you handsomely for it. Otherwise...

00:32:17.727 --> 00:32:20.856
How could our dear mistress abandon us?

00:32:24.151 --> 00:32:28.572
Oh, dear child, tell us what made you leave us?

00:32:32.451 --> 00:32:36.163
Come back! Come back, beloved!

00:34:43.790 --> 00:34:47.586
May God, the Father, have mercy on her soul.

00:34:48.128 --> 00:34:51.548
May God, the Son, have mercy on her soul.

00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:56.386
May God, the Holy Ghost, have mercy on her soul.

00:36:24.683 --> 00:36:26.101
Give the philosopher his dinner,

00:36:26.393 --> 00:36:28.186
then bring him back to the church.

00:36:33.692 --> 00:36:37.487
Tell them how the witch cast a spell on the huntsman.

00:36:38.905 --> 00:36:42.283
Shame, brother philosopher, that you didn't know Mikitka.

00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:48.832
Even his dogs adored him.

00:36:49.958 --> 00:36:52.043
He was a fine huntsman.

00:36:52.752 --> 00:36:57.590
Only recently did he have the misfortune

00:36:57.882 --> 00:37:00.218
of falling for the young mistress.

00:37:00.552 --> 00:37:02.345
Either he fell in love with her...

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.098
Or she bewitched him...

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:08.184
Nobody knows for sure, but the man was lost.

00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:14.441
One day the girl appeared in the stable and said,

00:37:14.733 --> 00:37:18.445
"Mikitka, let me put my foot on you to help me onto the horse."

00:37:18.737 --> 00:37:21.781
The poor man was so overjoyed he said,

00:37:22.282 --> 00:37:26.161
"I'd rather you climb onto my back."

00:37:27.162 --> 00:37:31.750
And the fool took her onto his back and went galloping away!

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:36.546
It's time we take the philosopher

00:37:36.838 --> 00:37:38.173
to where the corpse is lying.

00:38:24.719 --> 00:38:28.139
We'll leave you now.

00:38:29.974 --> 00:38:32.769
Just pray in earnest.

00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:34.521
Best of luck to you.

00:38:35.188 --> 00:38:39.442
Forgive us, but we must lock you up. By order of the master.

00:38:40.193 --> 00:38:42.434
That's all right. It's no more than three nights of work.

00:38:43.112 --> 00:38:46.407
And then the master will fill both of my pockets with gold.

00:39:27.907 --> 00:39:29.367
There's nothing to fear.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.744
She won't rise up from her coffin.

00:39:32.370 --> 00:39:34.455
Even corpses fear the word of God.

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:38.960
Am I right? Absolutely. You better stay there.

00:39:41.796 --> 00:39:44.716
Don't you know that a Cossack doesn't fear anything?

00:39:48.761 --> 00:39:50.597
There's no way for anyone to come in.

00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:54.809
And from corpses, I have prayers to protect me.

00:39:55.894 --> 00:40:00.315
As soon as I speak the holy words, no demon can harm me.

00:40:01.441 --> 00:40:04.485
They'll never touch me!

00:40:17.123 --> 00:40:22.503
What am I scared of? I just had too much to drink.

00:40:25.882 --> 00:40:30.595
Ah, candles... That's good.

00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:37.268
Lots of candles... to chase away...

00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:42.774
the gloom from the church... and light it up.

00:41:13.471 --> 00:41:15.807
It's nothing, only three nights.

00:41:19.936 --> 00:41:26.693
The church should be full of light. Cheerful and bright.

00:41:27.527 --> 00:41:28.528
There's nothing to fear.

00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.742
She won't touch me now, will she!

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:56.973
Ow! Oh, Satan! May God forgive me, poor sinner.

00:41:59.308 --> 00:42:00.685
Lots of light now.

00:42:04.564 --> 00:42:05.606
Well, let's begin.

00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:09.736
Blessed are... O Lord...

00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:15.491
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty.

00:42:16.034 --> 00:42:20.246
And they that live according to Thy Word.

00:42:21.622 --> 00:42:25.293
I wish it were not prohibited to smoke in the House of God.

00:42:26.878 --> 00:42:28.171
They that honor Thy commandments

00:42:28.463 --> 00:42:29.940
and walk in the path of righteousness.

00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:31.966
They that praise Thee in the hope of eternal...

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:34.093
What's wrong with some snuff?

00:42:38.848 --> 00:42:45.897
A good sniff... to clear the brain.

00:43:08.252 --> 00:43:11.798
Merciful Father! Thou art my strength...

00:43:22.266 --> 00:43:24.727
She's a witch! A witch come to haunt me!

00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:32.401
Sacred circle, save me! Sacred circle, protect me!

00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:33.693
Oh, my God...

00:43:34.695 --> 00:43:35.695
Oh, my God...

00:43:36.364 --> 00:43:40.535
Sacred circle, save me! Sacred circle, protect me!

00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:47.667
Away, Satan! Away!

00:43:49.377 --> 00:43:52.922
Blessed are they that fear the Almighty...

00:43:56.926 --> 00:43:59.220
Away! Away with you!

00:44:06.644 --> 00:44:10.231
God in Heaven, I call on Thee for help...

00:45:13.753 --> 00:45:14.753
Stay away!

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:33.416
- There's the philosopher! - He's finished.

00:46:42.842 --> 00:46:44.760
This is a lovely place to live!

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:48.389
You could fish all day in that river!

00:46:57.815 --> 00:46:59.734
Old man... Old man!

00:47:00.901 --> 00:47:03.779
I'm not going inside. I'll sleep right here.

00:47:04.655 --> 00:47:07.450
It's not allowed, philosopher. I have my orders.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:20.338
Have you got some borsch for us?

00:47:20.671 --> 00:47:22.381
We have, you old devil.

00:47:22.673 --> 00:47:26.969
- How does it taste? - Ask the philosopher.

00:47:50.242 --> 00:47:53.037
- Well? - What went on?

00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:11.389
Nothing much. Just some noises.

00:49:45.774 --> 00:49:50.488
A Cossack doesn't fear anything in this world.

00:49:58.704 --> 00:49:59.997
Let's go, Yavtukh.

00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:55.844
A Cossack is never afraid of anything.

00:51:02.184 --> 00:51:05.271
It's true, the first time, you really are afraid.

00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:08.148
But after a while, you're not so afraid.

00:51:08.691 --> 00:51:11.735
And after that, you're not afraid at all!

00:51:18.409 --> 00:51:23.497
Because there's nothing that can do me any harm.

00:51:34.216 --> 00:51:38.470
Lord God! Let not Thy divine Angel be turned against me.

00:51:38.971 --> 00:51:41.974
I ask Thee to spare me Thy terrible wrath.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:48.939
Have mercy upon Thy servant. I know my spirit's weak.

00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:58.115
God, save me from my weaknesses, preserve my heart from sin,

00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:01.493
my soul from evil...

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.747
Strengthen my spirit and protect me

00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:07.958
from the temptations of evil.

00:52:08.250 --> 00:52:09.250
Have mercy on...

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:13.922
God Almighty, save me! Heavenly Father, save me!

00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:20.095
O Lord! Save me from the demon!

00:52:21.138 --> 00:52:25.476
O Lord! Save me from the demon!

00:52:25.893 --> 00:52:29.563
God, give me strength!

00:52:29.938 --> 00:52:37.112
Holy Father in Heaven! Save me from the evil one!

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:55.964
Khoma!

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:01.887
Khoma!

00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:07.685
Khoma!

00:53:13.065 --> 00:53:15.359
Khoma!

00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:14.042
By the shades of night, may he go blind, turn his hair white.

00:54:14.668 --> 00:54:18.839
Bewitch him. Cover him with snow.

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:59.171
Hey, philosopher! On your feet!

00:55:45.634 --> 00:55:47.010
I want music!

00:55:50.556 --> 00:55:54.226
I want to have music right now!

00:56:39.229 --> 00:56:42.774
From the looks of it, he'll dance all day, that fellow.

00:56:43.442 --> 00:56:46.403
Yes, he can dance for a long time.

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:49.281
Hey, philosopher, what's wrong?

00:56:49.573 --> 00:56:51.742
Don't you see? I'm dancing.

00:56:53.911 --> 00:56:57.205
Oh, your hair has turned white!

00:56:59.583 --> 00:57:03.086
As white as milk. Just like good old Yavtukh.

00:57:07.299 --> 00:57:11.970
I must talk to your master. I'll explain everything.

00:57:13.889 --> 00:57:15.849
I don't want to pray there again!

00:57:32.157 --> 00:57:39.456
What? It's all going well? Were you able to stay awake?

00:57:41.166 --> 00:57:43.126
Yes, I was able to stay awake.

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.046
The devil lives in this house.

00:57:46.797 --> 00:57:48.924
I want to leave while I'm in one piece.

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:50.258
What do you mean?

00:57:51.593 --> 00:57:53.261
It's your daughter, sir...

00:57:54.513 --> 00:57:59.017
She may have noble blood in her veins, no doubt about that,

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:03.188
however, may God have mercy on her soul.

00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:06.149
What about my daughter?

00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:08.318
She's in league with the devil.

00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.530
She won't let me read the Scriptures in front of her.

00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:15.283
You will read them because she summoned you.

00:58:16.702 --> 00:58:19.746
She did not wish to bear a spiritual burden to the grave.

00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:23.250
The only way to assure her salvation is to say the prayers.

00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.714
Release me, I beg you! Don't make me go through with it.

00:58:29.006 --> 00:58:32.759
You will read. It's just one more night.

00:58:33.802 --> 00:58:37.597
You'll do godly work and I will reward you.

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.352
For all the gold in the world...

00:58:46.523 --> 00:58:50.360
I wouldn't read another prayer.

00:58:50.652 --> 00:58:51.737
That's enough!

00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:56.949
Philosopher...

00:59:00.412 --> 00:59:02.497
You're wrong if you think you can trifle with me.

00:59:03.915 --> 00:59:06.168
That sort of thing is fit for the seminary,

00:59:07.002 --> 00:59:08.628
but I won't tolerate it!

00:59:09.963 --> 00:59:13.842
I'll order the guards to lash you!

00:59:15.802 --> 00:59:17.512
There's nothing so excruciating

00:59:17.804 --> 00:59:19.681
as the leather lash on raw flesh.

00:59:20.307 --> 00:59:21.308
I know that.

00:59:22.184 --> 00:59:27.064
More than half a dozen are unbearable.

00:59:27.439 --> 00:59:30.692
What you don't know is how good my men are at it.

00:59:32.152 --> 00:59:37.699
They lash you, then we give them some vodka,

00:59:38.784 --> 00:59:40.368
and they begin again.

00:59:44.623 --> 00:59:45.665
You may go.

00:59:49.127 --> 00:59:50.837
Go back to your duties.

00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:57.177
If you fail to do them, you'll have a thousand lashes.

00:59:58.386 --> 01:00:02.140
But if you do them, one thousand gold pieces.

01:01:37.903 --> 01:01:42.490
A thousand gold pieces. The old miser was surely lying.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:48.038
Never mind, good master. I'll run away from here so fast

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:50.624
that even your dogs will never catch up with me.

01:02:28.703 --> 01:02:31.498
You should know better than to make such a detour.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.752
You nearly ruined your fine robe.

01:02:40.215 --> 01:02:45.095
That would've been a shame. How much did you pay for one yard?

01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:55.480
Why don't you keep your mouth shut, dear old Yavtukh?

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.669
Foolish dog.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:09.304
Not hungry? Then let's go to the church.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:25.320
Are you scared? That witch will give you the time of your life.

01:04:26.738 --> 01:04:29.991
Scared of a witch? Nothing scares a Cossack!

01:04:31.701 --> 01:04:33.244
I withstood it for two nights.

01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:35.413
With God's help, I'll make it three.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:43.463
She's haunting me because she's got the Devil inside her.

01:04:43.755 --> 01:04:46.341
I'd hate to think what sin she's guilty of.

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:57.018
Brother philosopher, it's time to go.

01:04:57.477 --> 01:04:58.728
Let's go to the church, dear.

01:05:14.494 --> 01:05:19.916
- Think of the torment she's in. - He was fated to go through it.

01:05:31.970 --> 01:05:39.352
I'll read for the third night and get a thousand gold pieces.

01:05:40.728 --> 01:05:43.231
I'll have a ball then, won't I, Yavtukh?

01:05:44.232 --> 01:05:45.525
Go say your prayers.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:51.614
Go say your prayers, philosopher.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:17.599
I won't be afraid. I swear, I won't be afraid.

01:07:02.977 --> 01:07:08.191
Lord God! From the depths of hell, I cry out to Thee.

01:07:08.691 --> 01:07:10.860
I pray Thee, have pity on me.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.947
Take heed of my cries.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.741
Drive out the terror that dwells in my heart.

01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:21.204
Let me not yield to the temptations of the evil one.

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:23.998
Lord God, help me...

01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:28.545
Thou art my Fortress...

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:33.007
My Redeemer, and my Savior...

01:07:49.899 --> 01:07:55.321
Lord God! From the depths of hell, I cry out to Thee.

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:08.042
God Almighty! Smite her with lightning!

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:12.005
Send down Thy wrath! Strike her down with Thy fury!

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:18.011
A curse upon you! With the wings of a bat!

01:08:21.347 --> 01:08:22.724
With the blood of a serpent!

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:26.769
I shall curse you!

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:30.607
Curse you!

01:09:06.392 --> 01:09:10.063
I summon the vampires! I summon the werewolves!

01:09:35.213 --> 01:09:39.550
I summon the vampires! I summon the werewolves!

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.217
I summon Viy!

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:26.139
Bring Viy here!

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.505
Get him!

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:01.549
Get him!

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:09.807
Raise my eyelids. I cannot see!

01:11:10.641 --> 01:11:14.437
Don't look him in the eye, or you're lost.

01:11:30.661 --> 01:11:31.704
A cock.

01:11:33.706 --> 01:11:34.999
I see him!

01:11:35.583 --> 01:11:39.921
Get away from me, you fiends!

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.924
Help!

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:13.264
The Fates were unkind to Khoma.

01:13:14.682 --> 01:13:16.017
It was the will of God.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:19.562
Let's drink to him, may his soul rest in peace.

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:30.323
Khoma was a fine young man.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:37.705
The kind of man I admire.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.461
But his life was wasted for nothing.

01:13:43.794 --> 01:13:45.212
I know where he went wrong.

01:13:46.213 --> 01:13:50.885
If he hadn't been afraid, the witch couldn't have harmed him.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:56.557
He should've spit on her tail, and made the sign of the cross.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:00.061
If anyone should know, it's me.

01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.355
In Kiev, the women who run stalls

01:14:02.647 --> 01:14:04.106
in the market are all witches.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:07.234
He wouldn't be dead if he hadn't been afraid.

01:14:09.528 --> 01:14:11.489
No one can prove he's dead.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:14.951
That's what everyone says.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.454
Maybe they imagined it.

01:14:19.038 --> 01:14:22.083
That stuff about how he died, because of the witch.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.921
After a flask of vodka, even I begin to see witches.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:36.180
Suppose he wasn't dead?

01:14:39.558 --> 01:14:43.521
Suppose that the one walking this way now... was him!

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.486
Now that's a good one!

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.582
- Are you working? - We're working.

01:15:06.377 --> 01:15:08.212
Keep on working then.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:27.565
The End
